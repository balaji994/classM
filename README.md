Twitter steaming program in java to collect the realtime tweets and store it as a collection in Mongo Db
Import all the files given 

Make sure you run a Mongo Db server, Specify the port number in the java program.
I used 27017 port make sure whih port you use.
I named the database as "twitterdb" and the collection as "tweets"
When you run the code it starts collecting the tweets and store it in twitterdb.
